# Decision Log

Append new entries at the top of the relevant section. Never delete entries; mark them
superseded instead.

## Locked design decisions (v0.9)
- Wheel is 30 ticks / 6 slices / 5 ticks per slice (was 24). Enables a true centre tick.
- No Miss precision tier; "Miss" means the Miss slice only.
- Enemy jitter replaced by spin resistance (passive trait or Hub-sourced). Flip and
  Respin are blocked while resistance > 0.
- Flip mirrors the wheel across the horizontal axis (opposite slice to the pointer).
- Triggering: every pointer triggers its slice on End Turn. Pointer attacks hit every
  pointer of the target wheel. Satellites act as bodyguards.
- Resolution order: defensive → offensive → statuses, simultaneous.
- Three-layer progression: netrun / campaign / profile. Class unlocks are profile-level.
- Rank (runs survived) replaces veterans/Trace: wheel upgrades, netrun tier access,
  station bonus scaling. Survivors keep everything; difficulty scales to match.
- Heat is one campaign meter. Threshold events fire once; modifiers apply while at/above.
- City Grid is one shared map for netruns, territory and raids; cleared Sites are used up
  and become claimable.
- Armory (cap 6) + persistent deployed assets resolves the audit's persistence question.
- Mainframe gate: minimum 3 Exploits (Intel, Breach, Virus); extras weaken the boss.
- Story paths: 5–6 per corporation, hidden and random; beats unlock in Exploit order.
- REBEL_CELL (the handler AI) is the final unlock corporation at ICE 10 on all others.
- ICE difficulty: 20 cumulative levels, ICE 5 is the average-player tuning target.
- Visual baseline: three worlds (cyberdeck / wireframe / zine), Cell colour hot pink.
- Full voice acting; fully solvable combat preview; rewind with checkpoints at random
  events.

## Implementation decisions
_(Claude Code: add entries here as you make them.)_

### 2026-09-24 — M0 Foundation
- **Engine used for verification: Godot 4.7.2** (only 4.6.2 / 4.7.x are installed on the
  dev machine). The project keeps its `config/features` pin at 4.3 per TECH_SPEC; nothing
  4.4+-only is used. Godot 4.4+ writes `*.uid` sidecars next to every script; they are
  git-ignored so a 4.3 checkout stays clean.
- **GUT 9.4.0** is vendored in `addons/gut/` (the tag for Godot 4.3–4.4). On 4.7.2 it logs
  one harmless static-init error (`gut_loader.gd:35` reads a project setting 4.7 no longer
  defines) and then runs every test. `.gutconfig.json` enables `include_subdirs` so
  `-gdir=res://tests` picks up `unit/` and `integration/`.
- **Fresh clone needs one import** before the `-s` tools work:
  `godot --headless --path . --import` builds the global script-class cache.
- **`-s` tool scripts compile before autoloads exist.** `tools/validate_content.gd`
  preloads `content_registry.gd`, so the registry looks SignalBus up by node path instead
  of naming the singleton. Other autoloads may name singletons directly.
- **ContentRegistry:** ids are collected from every `.tres/.res` under `res://content`
  *and* from resources nested inside them (Hub Cores, cards, slices…). The same instance
  reached twice is fine; two different instances with the same id is a duplicate and fails
  validation. Files are visited in sorted path order (rule 7: no dictionary-order ties).
  `validate()` runs every resource's `validate()` and prefixes problems with class + id.
- **RngService:** stream seed = `hash([campaign_seed, stream_name])` (TECH_SPEC §4). Save
  representation stores seeds and states as decimal strings because JSON round-trips
  integers exactly only up to 2^53 and `RandomNumberGenerator.state` is 64-bit.
- **SaveService skeleton:** every file gets a top-level `"version"`; `migrate()` walks a
  table of `from_version -> Callable` steps. JSON numbers come back as floats, so loaders
  must `int()` what they read; 64-bit values travel as strings (see RngService).
- **CampaignConfigData schema additions** so every GDD §11 number lives in
  `content/config/campaign_config.tres` (rule 5): `exploit_heat`; Cycle reward ranges
  (`cycles_combat_range`, `cycles_elite_range`, `cycles_router_range`); new group
  **Shop** (card/firmware/daemon price ranges, card removal price + increment, slice and
  Miss-slice overwrite prices); new group **Schematic costs** (rookie, node base, node
  upgrade costs, netrun boost range, Heat purchase amount/cost/increment, class unlock);
  Combat `ram_regen_per_turn` and `respin_ram_cost`. Ranges use `Vector2i(min, max)`.
  `validate()` checks min ≤ max and non-empty upgrade costs. Smoke test batch 3 covers it.
- **Heat thresholds in data (GDD §4.3):** MINOR at 10/20/30/40/60/70/80/90, MAJOR at
  25/50/75, PURGE at 100. MAJOR ongoing modifiers: 25 → ELITE_FREQUENCY_PCT, 50 →
  ENEMY_RESISTANCE +1, 75 → RAID_STRENGTH_PCT +25. MINOR one-time complications alternate
  the two examples the GDD gives (shop stock −1 / extra elite). `event_raid` stays null
  until M3 authors RaidData.
- **ICE ladder in data (GDD §11.9):** one change per level, in the order the GDD lists them
  within each band (ICE 1 = Heat gain +10% … ICE 6 = Heat sinks −15%, matching the schema
  README example). Bands 6–10, 11–15 and 16–20 list four changes each, so levels 10, 15 and
  20 carry no modifier and are marked "Reserved" in their description.
- **Input map (GDD §9.5):** actions `nudge_left` (Q), `nudge_right` (E), `cycle_target`
  (Tab), `end_turn` (Space), `rewind` (Z and Ctrl+Z), `inspect` (right mouse). Physical
  keycodes, so layouts other than QWERTY keep the key positions.
- **Display:** 1280×720 viewport, `canvas_items` stretch, `keep` aspect (TECH_SPEC §10).

## Open questions for the designer
_(Claude Code: add questions here instead of guessing on design.)_

### From M0 (2026-09-24)
- **Godot version.** The spec pins 4.3 but the dev machine has 4.6.2 and 4.7.x. Keep the
  4.3 pin (and install 4.3), or move the pin to 4.7 and GUT to 9.7.1?
- **"More elites" magnitude.** GDD gives no number for ICE 3, the Heat 25 ongoing modifier
  or the minor "extra elite" complication. Placeholder: `ELITE_FREQUENCY_PCT = 25`.
- **Other unspecified magnitudes**, all placeholders in `campaign_config.tres`:
  `BOSS_PHASE_EARLY = 10` (ICE 9), `REPAIR_COST_PCT = 25` (ICE 13),
  `SEIZED_RAID_STRENGTH_PCT = 25` (ICE 14).
- **ICE levels 10, 15 and 20** have no listed change (§11.9 lists 17 changes for 20
  levels). What should they add, or should bands repeat a change?
- **Minor Heat complications.** Which complication fires at which minor threshold? M0
  alternates shop stock −1 and extra elite; the raid at each MAJOR threshold needs RaidData
  in M3.
- **RAM cap.** TECH_SPEC §5.3 says RAM regenerates "+regen (cap)" but no cap appears in
  GDD §11. Needed for M1.
