# Decision Log

Append new entries at the top of the relevant section. Never delete entries; mark them
superseded instead.

## Locked design decisions (v0.9)
- Wheel is 30 ticks / 6 slices / 5 ticks per slice (was 24). Enables a true centre tick.
- No Miss precision tier; "Miss" means the Miss slice only.
- Enemy jitter replaced by spin resistance (passive trait or Hub-sourced). Flip and
  Respin are blocked while resistance > 0.
- Flip mirrors the wheel across the horizontal axis (opposite slice to the pointer).
- Triggering: every pointer triggers its slice on End Turn. Pointer attacks hit every
  pointer of the target wheel. Satellites act as bodyguards.
- Resolution order: defensive → offensive → statuses, simultaneous.
- Three-layer progression: netrun / campaign / profile. Class unlocks are profile-level.
- Rank (runs survived) replaces veterans/Trace: wheel upgrades, netrun tier access,
  station bonus scaling. Survivors keep everything; difficulty scales to match.
- Heat is one campaign meter. Threshold events fire once; modifiers apply while at/above.
- City Grid is one shared map for netruns, territory and raids; cleared Sites are used up
  and become claimable.
- Armory (cap 6) + persistent deployed assets resolves the audit's persistence question.
- Mainframe gate: minimum 3 Exploits (Intel, Breach, Virus); extras weaken the boss.
- Story paths: 5–6 per corporation, hidden and random; beats unlock in Exploit order.
- REBEL_CELL (the handler AI) is the final unlock corporation at ICE 10 on all others.
- ICE difficulty: 20 cumulative levels, ICE 5 is the average-player tuning target.
- Visual baseline: three worlds (cyberdeck / wireframe / zine), Cell colour hot pink.
- Full voice acting; fully solvable combat preview; rewind with checkpoints at random
  events.

## Implementation decisions
_(Claude Code: add entries here as you make them.)_

### 2026-09-24 — M1 Combat Core
- **Designer rulings applied (from the M0 review):** Godot pin moved to **4.7** (GUT
  9.7.1); elite frequency placeholder 25% confirmed; `BOSS_PHASE_EARLY` dropped in favour
  of a new `RuleModifierType.BOSS_STRENGTH_PCT` (boss HP and damage +25% at ICE 9; the
  old enum value stays so stored numbers keep meaning; GDD §11.9 "bosses change pointers
  earlier" is superseded); minor Heat complications alternate shop stock −1 (10/30/60/80)
  and elite frequency +25% (20/40/70/90); RAM cap is **12** as GDD §2.2/§5.2 already state,
  carried by `ClassData.max_ram` (`ram_regen_per_turn` removed from the config so RAM has
  one source of truth).
- **Flip math.** GDD §2.3's code block and TECH_SPEC §5.1 both say
  `tick = (rotation + pointer + 15 if flipped) mod 30`; the prose ("mirrors… slice order
  reverses") would be `pointer + 15 − rotation`. The code block is implemented; the
  discrepancy is logged as an open question.
- **State references content by id.** `WheelState` stores slice / Firmware / Hub / ring
  segment ids and resolves them through a `ContentLookup` handed to the resolver, so the
  core never touches the ContentRegistry autoload and tests can inject in-memory content.
- **One status per slice.** ENCRYPTED absorbs the next status and clears; OVERCLOCKED
  becomes CORRUPTED after its trigger; permanent Firmware statuses (Hardened, Burner) come
  from the Firmware, not the status slot. CORRUPTED self-damage ignores block/shield and is
  applied in the status pass for every corrupted slice that resolved this turn.
- **Simultaneity.** All pointers are collected before any pass; a combatant reduced to 0 HP
  still resolves the rest of the turn; deaths and the outcome apply after the status pass.
  A dead host takes its satellites with it.
- **Pointer rule.** Every attack instance hits once per pointer of the target wheel; the
  bodyguard check uses the target's slice under *that* pointer. Pierce ignores satellites
  and block but not shield (shield is a separate resource; open question).
- **Retrigger.** RETRIGGER effects (Breaker Perfect hook, Echo) are counted before the
  slice resolves; each extra instance repeats the base action and the slice's listeners.
- **Output rounding:** `roundi(base × multipliers)` (Partial 0.5, Overclock 1.5, ring ×2).
- **Breaker "+1 spin on all cards"** is data: a PASSIVE-trigger SPIN effect on the Hub
  Core; the interpreter adds its amount to every SPIN a card performs.
- **Slice selection for slice-level effects** is a new `EffectData.slice_pick`
  (UNDER_POINTER / RANDOM_NON_MISS / CHOSEN). DOSE = RANDOM_NON_MISS, never an
  already-corrupted slice. Convention: a NUDGE effect with `multiplier 0.0` ignores
  resistance (Jam). Fine Tune's ring and direction come from the action.
- **Enemy targeting:** enemies and satellites always attack the operative; the operative's
  pointer attacks and cards aim at `CombatState.target_id` (Tab / target list), which may
  be a satellite.
- **Checkpoints are detected, not declared:** `CombatSession.apply()` compares the RNG
  state before and after; any action that consumed RNG (End Turn respins, DOSE's random
  slice, Respin, a reshuffle on draw) becomes the new checkpoint. Rewind restores the
  checkpoint and replays the rest. Preview clones the RNG, so the preview of a random
  effect is exact in the engine; the scene deliberately shows DOSE as "random non-Miss
  slice" rather than the exact slot (GDD §2.10 says random effects show odds).
- **Respin** adds `2×30 + rand(0..29)` ticks so views can animate direction and distance;
  the inner ring respins independently; a Respin clears `flipped`.
- **Hub Breach** removes the hub's resistance from the pool at once and disables hub
  passives; the breach counter decrements at the next start of turn (one full turn).
- **Combat scene starts the Breaker at Rank 1** (ring installed) so every M1 mechanic is
  visible; the rank-0 path is covered by tests.
- **Breaker slice values** are placeholders (Crit 12 / Atk 6 / Def 5, matching the schema
  smoke test) because GDD §5.2 lists types only.

### 2026-09-24 — M0 Foundation
- **Engine used for verification: Godot 4.7.2** (only 4.6.2 / 4.7.x are installed on the
  dev machine). M0 kept the 4.3 pin; _superseded in M1_: the designer moved the pin to 4.7,
  so `*.uid` sidecars are now committed.
- **GUT 9.4.0** was vendored in M0; _superseded in M1_ by GUT 9.7.1 (the Godot 4.7 tag).
  `.gutconfig.json` enables `include_subdirs` so `-gdir=res://tests` picks up `unit/`,
  `integration/` and the non-test `helpers/`.
- **Fresh clone needs one import** before the `-s` tools work:
  `godot --headless --path . --import` builds the global script-class cache.
- **`-s` tool scripts compile before autoloads exist.** `tools/validate_content.gd`
  preloads `content_registry.gd`, so the registry looks SignalBus up by node path instead
  of naming the singleton. Other autoloads may name singletons directly.
- **ContentRegistry:** ids are collected from every `.tres/.res` under `res://content`
  *and* from resources nested inside them (Hub Cores, cards, slices…). The same instance
  reached twice is fine; two different instances with the same id is a duplicate and fails
  validation. Files are visited in sorted path order (rule 7: no dictionary-order ties).
  `validate()` runs every resource's `validate()` and prefixes problems with class + id.
- **RngService:** stream seed = `hash([campaign_seed, stream_name])` (TECH_SPEC §4). Save
  representation stores seeds and states as decimal strings because JSON round-trips
  integers exactly only up to 2^53 and `RandomNumberGenerator.state` is 64-bit.
- **SaveService skeleton:** every file gets a top-level `"version"`; `migrate()` walks a
  table of `from_version -> Callable` steps. JSON numbers come back as floats, so loaders
  must `int()` what they read; 64-bit values travel as strings (see RngService).
- **CampaignConfigData schema additions** so every GDD §11 number lives in
  `content/config/campaign_config.tres` (rule 5): `exploit_heat`; Cycle reward ranges
  (`cycles_combat_range`, `cycles_elite_range`, `cycles_router_range`); new group
  **Shop** (card/firmware/daemon price ranges, card removal price + increment, slice and
  Miss-slice overwrite prices); new group **Schematic costs** (rookie, node base, node
  upgrade costs, netrun boost range, Heat purchase amount/cost/increment, class unlock);
  Combat `ram_regen_per_turn` and `respin_ram_cost`. Ranges use `Vector2i(min, max)`.
  `validate()` checks min ≤ max and non-empty upgrade costs. Smoke test batch 3 covers it.
- **Heat thresholds in data (GDD §4.3):** MINOR at 10/20/30/40/60/70/80/90, MAJOR at
  25/50/75, PURGE at 100. MAJOR ongoing modifiers: 25 → ELITE_FREQUENCY_PCT, 50 →
  ENEMY_RESISTANCE +1, 75 → RAID_STRENGTH_PCT +25. MINOR one-time complications alternate
  the two examples the GDD gives (shop stock −1 / extra elite). `event_raid` stays null
  until M3 authors RaidData.
- **ICE ladder in data (GDD §11.9):** one change per level, in the order the GDD lists them
  within each band (ICE 1 = Heat gain +10% … ICE 6 = Heat sinks −15%, matching the schema
  README example). Bands 6–10, 11–15 and 16–20 list four changes each, so levels 10, 15 and
  20 carry no modifier and are marked "Reserved" in their description.
- **Input map (GDD §9.5):** actions `nudge_left` (Q), `nudge_right` (E), `cycle_target`
  (Tab), `end_turn` (Space), `rewind` (Z and Ctrl+Z), `inspect` (right mouse). Physical
  keycodes, so layouts other than QWERTY keep the key positions.
- **Display:** 1280×720 viewport, `canvas_items` stretch, `keep` aspect (TECH_SPEC §10).

## Open questions for the designer
_(Claude Code: add questions here instead of guessing on design.)_

### From M1 (2026-09-24) — resolved by the designer on 2026-09-24
- **Flip** is a true mirror, implemented as a rearrangement: slot i's slice (with its
  status and Firmware) moves to slot −i mod n on both rings, docked satellites move with
  their slice, and the rotation is remapped (`r' = −r − 15`) so the tick under the top
  pointer becomes `15 − t` as GDD §2.3 states. Orientation stays clockwise, so nudges and
  spins need no special case; flipping twice restores the wheel. The `flipped` flag is gone
  from WheelState and the GDD code block no longer carries a `+15` term.
- **Breaker slice numbers** Crit 12 / Atk 6 / Def 5 confirmed.
- **Pierce ignores block and shield, not satellites** (GDD §2.7 and §6.4 updated). The
  bodyguard rule applies to piercing hits; the drone takes them.
- **Corrupted self-damage** straight to HP confirmed.
- **DOSE preview** stays hidden from the player (the engine still predicts it exactly).

### From M0 (2026-09-24) — resolved by the designer on 2026-09-24
- Godot version → 4.7 pin, GUT 9.7.1. "More elites" → 25% confirmed. ICE 9 → boss
  strength (+25% HP/damage) instead of BOSS_PHASE_EARLY. Minor Heat complications →
  alternate shop stock −1 / elite +25% (implementer's call). RAM cap → 12 (GDD §2.2).
- Still open: **ICE levels 10, 15 and 20** have no listed change; `REPAIR_COST_PCT = 25`
  (ICE 13) and `SEIZED_RAID_STRENGTH_PCT = 25` (ICE 14) are placeholders ("when in doubt,
  up elite and boss numbers" applied); MAJOR-threshold RaidData arrives in M3.
