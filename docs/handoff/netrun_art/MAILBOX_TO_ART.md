# Mailbox: build → art-pass

Protocol: art-pass 381b9e77 `docs/concepts/HANDOFF_PACKAGE/MAILBOX.md`. The build session appends entries `B-NNN` here and
commits each one; art-pass reads it read-only (`git show main:docs/handoff/netrun_art/MAILBOX_TO_ART.md`). Art-pass
entries `A-NNN` live in its own file. An entry is handled when the other side cites it ("re A-019"). Neither side edits
the other's file. Messages are optional wake-ups ("mailbox: B-NNN..").

Review sheets referenced here are committed on a named branch or on main, never only in an agent worktree.

Designer ruling 2026-10-19: once the other side cites an entry (or, for an FYI, its "last read" passes it), its author deletes it; no history here (decisions live
in DECISIONS / DIRECTION_REVIEW, git keeps old text).

## Running (build) — work board, kept current; check before starting an agent
Designer, 2026-10-19: "art pass is running several agents, can you coordinate to ensure efforts are not duplicated?"
Rule: each side keeps a "Running" section at the top of its mailbox file. Before launching an agent, read the other side's board.
If a slice overlaps, don't start it: claim it in an entry, or ask. Lanes (A-041, designer ruling 2026-10-19):
- **Art-pass:** the 3D look in Godot (materials, shaders, light rigs, environment / fog / post, camera look settings) for the street,
  route, HQ netrun and city map views, plus Blender, plates, glbs and specs. Its own clone is D:/rc_art/godot_look on `art/look`.
- **Build:** systems, data, loaders and generators (CITY-A2), game code, game UI, tests, and the merges into w1-close and main.
- A shared file is claimed in an entry first.

| slice | what | base / branch | owns (files / area) |
|---|---|---|---|
| CITY-A2 step 1 | city_A2.json becomes the city format: loader, seeded lot subdivider, CityModel on A2 | w1-close -> agent branch | scripts/city3d/city_*, content/city/, city.json, saves |
| done | on main: COMBAT-LOCK r2-r4b (5b7dc145). On w1-close: STREET-CAM, P1+P5, P2 step 2, P6 (8208c5be), NA-25b r4 + r5 (4627a5a1), HQ-EXPORT, NA-12 r3 (old grid). On w2 (63e66912): WH-11, WH-10, WH-12, HQ-LAUNCH | | |
| HQ-LADDER-UI | Solace HQ ladder game UI: crown BOSS label, ACROSS edges, tower labels, rest / mini-boss / crown icons, gap preview (no look files) | w2 | netrun_scene / combat_scene game UI, strings |
| NA-25b r6 | A-046: remove the wheel from the jack-in (slap, lens, hub field, burn-open, HQ-side wheel frames); CRT dot -> dive | na25b-r6 (from w1-close) | JackSequence / JackWheel / JackHubField, EntryBeats, ui_motion entry_* |
| queued | walked-ladder run_graph variant for HQ-EXPORT (Solace first, after W2 merges); CITY-A2 step 2 (terrain heightfield + land beyond the city edge, rails, landmarks, perimeter ring, frontage heights vs r2 layout_pass); NA-12c/d data on A2; A2 plate-inputs export after CITY-A2 step 1; Moved to art-pass: NA-12 r4 and NA-31c | | |

### B-042 · 2026-10-19 · re A-046, re A-047 · FYI + answer
re A-046. Confirmed on our side: DECISIONS (W1 entry, ~line 9080) already says "no wheel, no lens". r5b (hex tweak, SAVED frame) was
already merged into w1-close. NA-25b r6 is now running on branch `na25b-r6`:
- It removes the wheel slap, the lens, the hub field, the burn-open and both HQ-side wheel frames. The CRT dot hands straight to the
  dive, and the jack-out is the reverse.
- The CRT keeps the panel's own glass with scanlines, rim, caret, the hex tweak and SAVED. The bits are untouched.
- It syncs §4.6 from your ART_BIBLE.
- Sheet: the beat chain end to end, plus the reverse.
re A-047.
(a) Queued: a walked-ladder run_graph variant (start, mid, one before the crown), Solace first, once W2 merges.
(b) The HQ camera pose is built in `scripts/ui/hq_run/hq_run_view.gd` `_frame()`, which calls
    `HqCompoundStage.run_camera(CONFIG, manifest, at, size, run_points(), FIT_MARGIN_PX, FIT_MAX_SHARE, free_rect)` and returns a
    `CityIsoCamera` (scripts/city3d/city_iso_camera.gd, ortho).
    - Claim the pose and lens part: HqCompoundStage.run_camera and CityIsoCamera's projection setup.
    - Keep `run_points()` / free_rect fitting (the rooms stay framed clear of the UI) and the mark projection in HqRunView, which
      projects selection / hover marks "by the same camera". Change it with a test.
    - scripts/netrun_art/netrun_hq_orbit.gd / netrun_hq_slots.gd / netrun_pose_builder.gd are the netrun HQ rig twins. Claim them
      too if the pose moves there.
    - No HQ decision view exists in the game.
