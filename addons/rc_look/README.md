# rc_look: the LOOK-TOOLBOX

Reusable visual building blocks for REBEL_CELL, shared by the UI layers and the 3D renders so every view reads the same
light and colour. Look only: no rules, content ids or save data. Every module has an API class, one shader include,
its numbers in a `.tres`, a lab stage (`lab/look_lab.tscn`), tests in `tests/test_manifest.json` and an entry in
`docs/DECISIONS.md` under LOOK-TOOLBOX. Quality tier and accessibility flags reach a module only through `RcLookQuality`.

## Foundation (modules 1-3)

| API | What |
|---|---|
| `RcLookTokens` (`config/look_tokens.tres`), `tools/sync_tokens.gd` | Palette colours as shader globals `rc_<token>` |
| `shaders/rc_look.gdshaderinc` | tokens, sRGB transfer, luma, saturation, hash / noise / fbm, facet ids (`rcl_` prefix) |
| `RcLookQuality.resolve / of`, `RcLookQualityState`, `config/look_quality.tres` | tier and accessibility flags to a module's settings |
| `RcLookLabStage`, `lab/look_lab.tscn` | lab stages and captures with GPU ms |
| `tools/look_sheet.py` | reference / twin / Godot (+ diff) sheets |

## Module 9: grade (post chain)

One exposure curve for every rendered image: sRGB in, linear x exposure, extended-Reinhard highlight shoulder (white
point W lands on 1), back to sRGB, x tint (clamped), saturation around the display luma.

| API | What |
|---|---|
| `shaders/rc_grade.gdshaderinc`: `rcl_grade(srgb, exposure, white, tint, saturation)`, `rcl_expose`, `rcl_shoulder` | the shader side |
| `RcLookGrade.grade(c, exposure, white, tint, saturation)`, `.grade_preset(c, preset)`, `.shoulder(l, white)` | exact GDScript mirror (tests, contrast checks, previews) |
| `RcLookGrade.preset(name)`, `config/look_grade.tres` (`RcLookGradeConfig`, `RcLookGradePreset`) | presets: `cel` (identity), `aaa2` (the 3D city render: exposure 8, W 3) |
| `RcLookGrade.apply(material, preset, prefix = "grade_")` | fills `<prefix>exposure / white / tint / saturation` |
| lab: `--module=grade` | each preset on grey and neon-token ramps, shader strip over mirror chips |

Call sites: `shaders/arena/combat_backdrop.gdshader` (`graded`), `CombatBackdrop.graded` (numbers from CityConfig
`backdrop_*`, per-corp tint). Next: the UI grades (city_tilt_shift, screen_grey, route_grade) and city_post (announced
to art-pass first).
